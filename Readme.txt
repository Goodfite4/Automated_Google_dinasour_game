info:
This bot is very mediocre optimisation wise as google's dinosaur game is very unpredictable as it's all randomly generated.
Things like two trees very close by will make it so the bot doesn't have time to check for the next tree and jump over.
From the start of the game it is very RNG (random number generator) dependent on how far the bot goes. I have had games
where it goes over 10k and some games it just flops on the 3 big trees inbetween the first speed transition.

Before you begin:
    1. This bot was made for chrome://dino on Google Chrome. the screen resolution was 1920x1080. You must calibrate the
        variables that have comments beside them with the proper x and y co-ordinates.
    2. This code has no Failsafe, although it doesn't do anything but press up or down and space once. If you would like to end the
        code then just press the stop button. 

instructions:
    A. Open the game at chrome://dino
    B. Die once to get the game over screen
    C. Calibrate the variables to the perfect distances according to the comments on main.py
    D. Run Main.py and tab over without starting the game, let the code start the game.
    E. Good luck.
